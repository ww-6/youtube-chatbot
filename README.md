# YouTube Chatbot

This chatbot provides a summary of the YouTube video, and you can ask the chatbot any question about the video. The chatbot provides timestamps with its answers, which can help you go back and find the relevant content in the video.

You don't need a GPU to run this app. You can try out the app on Hugging Face:
